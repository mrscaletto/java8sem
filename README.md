#TASK
Java Applet "Motion of an elastic ball in a box with vertical walls."
Flat case: movement inside a rectangle. When approaching the wall, the ball begins to experience a “force of attraction”, inversely proportional to the distance from its center to the wall.

Variable parameters: initial position of the ball (coordinates, speed of initial movement along each of the axes), “gravity” (the same for all walls).

You can enter pseudo-3D image elements.

Implementation language: Java.
